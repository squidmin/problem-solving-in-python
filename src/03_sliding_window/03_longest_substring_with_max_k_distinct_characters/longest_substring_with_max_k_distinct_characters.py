"""
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.
  You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

Example 1:
  Input: String="araaci", K=2
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".

Example 2:
  Input: String="araaci", K=1
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".

Example 3:
  Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
  Output: 5
  Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

Example 4:
  Input: String="cbbebi", K=10
  Output: 6
  Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '10' distinct characters is "cbbebi".


Hint:
  Use a hashmap to keep track of the number of occurrences of distinct characters.
  The length of the hash map (e.g., the number of distinct characters found) will affect the shrinking of
    the sliding window.
"""

"""
Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of characters in the input string.
  The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character
  only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N + N),
  which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

Space complexity: The algorithmâ€™s space complexity is O(K), as it will store a maximum
  of K + 1 characters in the HashMap.
